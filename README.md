## Aditional information

This was a 1 week project built for a job application.
The most challenging part was that this is actually my first ever contact with React, I stated that this was a 1 week project, but it was actually built in 3 days, since I had to learn how to code in React before starting out.
Since this is my first ever application built using React, I'm actually really proud of what i achieved.
